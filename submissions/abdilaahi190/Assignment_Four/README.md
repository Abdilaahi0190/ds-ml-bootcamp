# Assignment Four: House Price Prediction

This folder contains my solution for Lesson 4: Linear Regression and Random Forest.

## Files
- `house_price_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with data cleaning, model training, and evaluation.
- `reflection_paper.md`: My answers to the reflection questions.
- `requirements.txt`: Python packages used.

## Usage
Run the notebook to see the analysis and model results. The notebook automatically handles data cleaning of `house_l3_dataset.csv`.
